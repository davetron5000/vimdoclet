vimdoclet - A doclet that generates vim help files

ant     - this will compile all code
ant jar - this will create a jar file, if you wish to more easily move the
          class files around
ant run - this will run the doclet on the Java source (or any source really
          but the excludes are set up to run on the JDK source)
          You must set two command line properties:
          vimdoclet.source.root 
            to point to your java source root (which is not the actual
            root of the jdk src package, but the root of the source
            of the jre classes themselves).  You must
          vimdoclet.output.dir
            The output directory where you want your helpfiles to
            go.  I suggest ~/.vim/doc
