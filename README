vimdoclet - A doclet that generates vim help files

ant     - this will compile all code
ant jar - this will create a jar file, if you wish to more easily move the
          class files around
ant run - this will run the doclet on the Java source (or any source really
          but the excludes are set up to run on the JDK source)
          See the wiki for more details
